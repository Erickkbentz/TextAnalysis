# TextAnalysis

Small Text Analysis project used to compare two sets of Articles for a Paired Case Study.

The two cases being compared are the reporting of the persecution and arrests of Alaxei Navalny and Julian Assange by the New York Times.

Many parts of the code are rough and "hacky" for the sake of saving time since I am using these results for a paper in my Philosophy class in school.

These results are not meant to be extensive and do not suggest any definite conclusions. They only provide a starting place for comparing quantitative attributes.
